# Oso's Table Game
A **strategy-based** game developed in vanilla JavaScript. Nothing fancy in terms of graphics nor is it addictive gameplay-wise, yet some complex strategies could be used to gain an advantage agains your opponent. This is a local 2-player game which can run in just about any (modern-*ish*) browser.

## Controls

**Left Click** - place blocks / barriers
**Scroll Wheel** - change direction (left-right / top-bottom)

## License and Copyright

The game has been discontinued a long time ago (it was a 1-hour challenge), but I needed a place to upload it - no need for feedback, I'm already aware this is crappy! This project was created from scratch by **VintilÄƒ Valentin-Ioan**. The code is licensed under **GPLv3**. The images and sound effects used can be found in the public dommain - they are *not* subject to copyright/licensing.
